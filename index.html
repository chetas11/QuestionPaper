                <p>In the following
                question, a sentence with four words
                printed in bold is given. These words are
                numbered as (1), (2), (3) and (4). One of
                these four words may either be misspelt
                or inappropriate in the context of the
                sentence. Find out the word(s) that is
                wrongly spelt or inappropriate and mark
                the relevant option as your answer. If all
                the words printed in bold are correct,

                    Why do we travel? It's not the flying I
                    mind – I will always be awed by the
                    physics that gets a fat metal bird into the
                    upper troposphere. The rest of the
                    journey, however, can feel like a tedious
                    lesson in the ills of modernity, from the
                    pre-dawn X-ray screening to the sad
                    airport malls peddling crappy souvenirs.
                    It's globalisation in a nutshell, and it
                    sucks. And yet here we are, herded in
                    ever greater numbers on to planes that
                    stay the same size. Sometimes we travel
                    because we have to. Sometimes we travel
                    because we want to, because the
                    annoyances of the airport are outweighed
                    by the visceral thrill of being someplace
                    new. Because work is stressful and our
                    blood pressure is too high and we need a
                    vacation. Because home is boring.
                    Because the flights were on sale.
                    Travel, in other words, is a basic human
                    desire. We're a migratory species, even if
                    our migrations are powered by jet fuel
                    and Chicken McNuggets. But here's my
                    question: is this collective urge to travel
                    – to put some distance between ourselves
                    and everything we know – still a
                    worthwhile compulsion? Or is it like the
                    taste for saturated fat: one of those
                    instincts we should have left behind in the
                    Pleistocene epoch? Because if travel is
                    just about fun, then I think the new
                    security measures at airports have killed
                    it. The good news, at least for those of
                    you reading this while stuck on a tarmac,
                    is that pleasure is not the only consolation
                    of travel. In fact, several new science
                    papers suggest that getting away – and it
                    doesn't even matter where you're going –
                    is an essential habit of effective thinking.It's not about a holiday, or relaxation: it's
                    about the taxing act itself, putting some
                    miles between home and wherever you
                    happen to spend the night.
                    The reason such travels are mentally
                    useful involves a quirk of cognition, in
                    which problems that feel "close" – and the
                    closeness can be physical, temporal or
                    even emotional – get contemplated in a
                    more concrete manner. As a result, when
                    we think about things that are nearby,
                    our thoughts are _____(A)_____,
                    bound by a more limited set of
                    associations. While this habit can be
                    helpful – it allows us to focus on the facts
                    at hand – it also inhibits our imagination.
                    When we escape from the place we spend
                    most of our time, the mind is suddenly
                    made aware of all those errant ideas we'd
                    suppressed. We start thinking about
                    obscure possibilities that never would
                    have occurred to us if we'd stayed back
                    on the farm. Furthermore, this more
                    relaxed sort of cognition comes with
                    practical advantages, especially when
                    we're trying to solve difficult problems.

                <p>15. Which of the following is true with
                respect to the passage?
                A. An escape from a regular environment
                allows us to think about possibilities,
                which we would otherwise never explore.
                B. Apart from deriving pleasure, we can
                also develop a habit of effective thinking
                through travelling.
                C. The author finds the idea of an
                aeroplane flying in the troposphere
                absurd.

                <p>16. With which of the following is the
                author most likely to agree?
                A. Travelling allows us to be aware of the
                ideas suppressed within us.
                B. Globalisation has benefitted us in many
                ways.
                C. Travelling bridges the distance
                between ourselves and everything we
                know.
